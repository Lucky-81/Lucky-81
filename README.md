- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lucky-81

- 👀 I’m interested in ... So much actually, especially when it comes to programming, coding or anything to do with software
You might ask why such over enthusiasm?  Well, I have always viewed anyone who's capable of such feats as pretty amazing since I was a little kid in fact. 
And my father was a Mechanical engineer but, a wizzz at anything on a screen! Unfortunately he passed in 2011, so I'm going on this learning programming/ coding journey 
So that I'm able to connect with my old man in a way I was unable to do so when he was around..cornie I know but its definitely 💯

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... anything I can and I'm takin notes! Though it would be nice, if I knew some sort of order I should learn in, tips or
 even just an opportunity to get to know a person.

- 💞️ I’m looking to help anyone with any project, problem, or creation. Because,  I learn better hands on!
on ...

- 📫 How to reach me ...For now,  I can be reached at mysalvation2019@gmail.com & triedandtrue2021@outlook.com, but I am down as I said before to actually get to know
A person or team. I have other easier contact information for that. 

- Everyone,  thank you for taking the time to read my introduction to Github for those that read it. And for 
Any who didn't, it's ok and thank you for helping to create a place such as this.
